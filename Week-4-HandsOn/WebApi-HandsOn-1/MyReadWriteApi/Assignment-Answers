1. RESTful Web Service, Web API & Microservice Concepts
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A RESTful web service adheres to the following principles:

Representational State Transfer: Resources are manipulated through the transfer of their representations (e.g., JSON, XML).

Stateless: Each client request to the server contains all necessary information; the server maintains no client context between requests.

Client-Server: A clear separation of concerns exists between the client (UI/UX) and the server (data/business logic).

Cacheable: Responses can be cached by clients or intermediaries to improve performance.

Layered System: Intermediate servers can be introduced without affecting client-server interactions.

Uniform Interface: Resources are identified by URIs, manipulated via representations, and messages are self-descriptive.

A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules enabling communication between applications over HTTP. RESTful web services are a prevalent type of Web API.

A Microservice is an architectural approach decomposing a large application into small, independent, and loosely coupled services, often communicating via RESTful APIs. This facilitates independent development, deployment, and scaling.

Difference (WebService vs. WebAPI): Historically, "Web Service" often referred to SOAP (XML-based) services. "Web API" is a modern term primarily referring to flexible, JSON-based RESTful APIs.

Data Format Flexibility: RESTful APIs are not restricted to XML responses; JSON is the widely preferred and common format due to its lightweight nature. Other formats are also supported.

2. HttpRequest & HttpResponse
Communication between a client and a web server involves an HttpRequest from the client and an HttpResponse from the server.

HttpRequest: A message sent by the client to the server. Components include:

Method (Action Verb): e.g., GET, POST.

URL: Resource identifier.

Headers: Request metadata (e.g., Content-Type).

Body (optional): Data payload for the server.

HttpResponse: A message sent by the server in response to an HttpRequest. Components include:

Status Code: Numeric code indicating request outcome (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

Headers: Response metadata.

Body (optional): Returned data or error message.

3. Action Verbs
HTTP methods, or Action Verbs, specify the intended operation on a resource. In .NET Core Web API, these are declared as attributes on action methods:

[HttpGet] (Read): Retrieves data.

Example: [HttpGet] public ActionResult<IEnumerable<string>> Get() { ... }

[HttpPost] (Create): Submits data to create a new resource.

Example: [HttpPost] public ActionResult Post([FromBody] string value) { ... }

[HttpPut] (Update/Replace): Modifies an existing resource or creates it if not found.

Example: [HttpPut("{id}")] public ActionResult Put(int id, [FromBody] string value) { ... }

[HttpDelete] (Delete): Removes a specified resource.

Example: [HttpDelete("{id}")] public ActionResult Delete(int id) { ... }

4. HTTP Status Codes in WebAPI
HTTP Status Codes convey the result of an HTTP request. In .NET Core Web API, these are returned via ActionResult types:

200 OK: Request succeeded. (e.g., Ok(data);)

201 Created: New resource created. (e.g., CreatedAtAction(...);)

204 No Content: Success, no content returned. (e.g., NoContent();)

400 Bad Request: Client-side error. (e.g., BadRequest("Invalid input.");)

401 Unauthorized: Authentication required. (e.g., Unauthorized();)

403 Forbidden: Access denied. (e.g., Forbid();)

404 Not Found: Resource not found. (e.g., NotFound();)

500 Internal Server Error: Generic server-side error. (e.g., StatusCode(500, "Error");)

5. Demonstration of a Simple WebAPI (Read, Write Actions)
A .NET Core Web API with Read and Write actions was created and demonstrated.

API Structure:

Controller (ValuesController.cs): A C# class handling HTTP requests.

Inheritance: From Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase.

Attributes: [ApiController] enables API-specific behaviors; [Route("api/[controller]")] defines the base URL.

Action Verbs: Attributes ([HttpGet], [HttpPost], etc.) map methods to HTTP actions.

Action Method: Public methods within the controller containing API logic, returning ActionResult types.

Demonstration Steps & Testing:

Project created using dotnet new webapi -n MyReadWriteApi.

ValuesController.cs added with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods.

Program.cs updated for controller and Swagger configuration.

Swashbuckle.AspNetCore NuGet package added via dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.

Application executed using dotnet run.

Endpoints tested via Swagger UI (http://localhost:5128/swagger) and curl:

GET: Confirmed expected output (e.g., ["value1", "value2", "value3"]).

POST: New value added, verified (201 Created).

PUT: Existing value updated, verified (204 No Content).

DELETE: Value removed, verified (204 No Content).

6. WebAPI Configuration Files
Configuration files for a .NET Core Web API include Program.cs, appSettings.json, and launchSettings.json. Older .NET 4.5 Framework applications used Route.config and WebAPI.config.

Program.cs: The application's entry point. Configures the web host, registers services for Dependency Injection (DI) (e.g., AddControllers(), AddSwaggerGen()), and sets up the HTTP request pipeline (e.g., UseSwagger(), MapControllers()).

appSettings.json: Stores application-wide settings (e.g., connection strings). Supports environment-specific versions (e.g., appsettings.Development.json).

launchSettings.json: Defines development-specific launch profiles (URLs, environment variables). Not used in production.

Route.config & WebAPI.config (Older .NET 4.5 Framework):

Route.config: Defined URL routing rules. In .NET Core, routing is configured in Program.cs.

WebAPI.config: Configured API-specific settings (e.g., formatters). In .NET Core, these functions are integrated into Program.cs.
