Analysis of My Financial Forecasting Code
I've provided a C# program that calculates future value using two recursive methods: one standard and one with memoization. Let me break down the analysis of my code.

1. Understanding the Recursive Algorithms
Both my CalculateFutureValue and CalculateFutureValueMemo are recursive functions designed to compute the future value of an initialAmount growing at a growthRate over a certain number of years.

Key Components of Recursion:

Base Case:

if (years == 0) return initialAmount;

This is the fundamental stopping condition. When the number of years to forecast reaches zero, it means I've reached the starting point, and the initialAmount is returned as the future value for that 'zero-year' period. Without this, my recursion would never end, leading to a StackOverflowException.

Recursive Step:

return CalculateFutureValue(initialAmount, growthRate, years - 1) * (1 + growthRate);

This line defines how the problem is broken down. To find the future value for years, I calculate the future value for years - 1 (the smaller sub-problem) and then apply the growthRate for the current year. This process continues until the years parameter reaches the base case of 0.

2. Time Complexity Analysis
Let N be the years (number of periods).

CalculateFutureValue(initialAmount, growthRate, years) (Standard Recursive)

Time Complexity: O(N) (Linear)

Explanation: For each year from N down to 0, my function makes exactly one recursive call.

CalculateFutureValue(N) calls CalculateFutureValue(N-1)

CalculateFutureValue(N-1) calls CalculateFutureValue(N-2)

...

CalculateFutureValue(1) calls CalculateFutureValue(0) (the base case).

Each call performs a constant amount of work (a comparison, a subtraction, a multiplication). Therefore, the total work is directly proportional to the number of years. This is efficient for the task.

CalculateFutureValueMemo(initialAmount, growthRate, years, Dictionary<int, double> memo) (Memoized Recursive)

Time Complexity: O(N) (Linear)

Explanation: I've correctly implemented memoization, which is designed to optimize recursive functions that suffer from overlapping sub-problems.

The core idea of memoization is to store the results of function calls (memo.Add(years, result)) and reuse them if the function is called again with the same inputs (memo.ContainsKey(years)).

However, in this specific problem (simple compound interest where FV(n) only depends on FV(n-1)), there are no overlapping sub-problems. Each CalculateFutureValueMemo(..., years) is called only once for each unique years value during the top-down recursion.

Therefore, while the memoization logic is correctly applied, it does not provide an asymptotic performance improvement for this particular problem over the standard recursive solution. Both will have a linear time complexity of O(N). The primary benefit of the memoized version in this specific case is demonstrating the memoization pattern, rather than gaining significant speed.

3. Optimization and Practical Considerations
Why Memoization is Powerful (but less so here):
Memoization is extremely powerful for recursive problems where the same sub-problems are computed many times. A classic example is the naive Fibonacci sequence calculation (F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)), which has exponential time complexity without memoization due to redundant calculations of F(k) for smaller k values. Memoization transforms this to O(N). My CalculateFutureValue problem, however, is a simpler linear recurrence relation, so it doesn't benefit from memoization's core strength of avoiding redundant computations.

Stack Overflow Risk:
Both recursive solutions consume stack space with each function call. If the years value is very large (e.g., hundreds of thousands or millions), I could encounter a StackOverflowException. This is a common limitation of deep recursion in languages like C#.

Iterative Solution (Often Preferred for this Problem):
For a linear recurrence relation like compound interest, an iterative solution using a for loop is generally the most practical and efficient approach in terms of both performance and memory usage, as it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and the risk of stack overflow. It would also have O(N) time complexity.

Example of an iterative approach:

static double CalculateFutureValueIterative(double initialAmount, double growthRate, int years)
{
    double futureValue = initialAmount;
    for (int i = 0; i < years; i++)
    {
        futureValue *= (1 + growthRate);
    }
    return futureValue;
}


Conclusion
My code correctly implements both a standard recursive and a memoized recursive solution for financial forecasting. For this specific problem (compound interest), both have a time complexity of O(N). While memoization is a crucial optimization for many recursive problems with overlapping sub-problems, it doesn't provide an asymptotic speedup here. For very large numbers of years, an iterative solution would be more robust against stack overflow issues.
